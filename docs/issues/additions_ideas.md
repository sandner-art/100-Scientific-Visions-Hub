**How "Active" Status is Tracked (and other statuses)**

The "Active" status (and others like "Recent", "Inactive", "Stale") displayed in the `README.md` comes from the `paper.status` field. This field is populated in `analyzeSinglePaper` and `analyzeSubpaper` using the following logic:

```javascript
// From analyzeSinglePaper (similar in analyzeSubpaper)
// ...
const statusFromProgress = s; // 's' is the status from progress.md
paper.status = s || (await this.inferStatusFromActivity(repo, 'papers/')); // Infer only if not in progress.md
// ...
```

This means:
1.  **Priority to `progress.md`:** If `papers/progress.md` (or `papers/SUB_DIR/progress.md`) explicitly defines a `Status: Active` (or any other status), that value is used.
2.  **Automatic Inference as Fallback:** If no status is found in `progress.md`, the script calls `this.inferStatusFromActivity()`. This function looks at the last commit date to the repository (or a specific path within it):
    *   Less than 7 days ago: Inferred as "Active"
    *   Less than 30 days ago: Inferred as "Recent"
    *   Less than 90 days ago: Inferred as "Inactive"
    *   90 days or more ago: Inferred as "Stale"

So, the "Active Projects" count in your `README.md` includes:
*   Papers explicitly marked "Active" in their `progress.md`.
*   Papers without a status in `progress.md` but whose repository (or relevant sub-path) has seen commit activity in the last 7 days.

**Is it "truly tracked automatically?"** Yes, in the sense that if you don't specify a status, the system *will* try to determine one based on recent activity. If you *do* specify a status in `progress.md`, that manual entry overrides the automatic inference. This gives you both automation and control.

**3. Areas for Improvement to the Main README.md (Future Additions)**

The current README is a great start! Here are some ideas for potential future enhancements, ranging from simple to more complex:

**Data Presentation & Detail:**

*   **Breakdown by Research Area:**
    *   Similar to "By Status" and "Priority Distribution", you could add a section summarizing how many papers fall into each "Research Area" (taken from `100SV.md`). This would require aggregating this data in `generateStats`.
*   **"Needs Attention" List:**
    *   Instead of just "Stale: X", you could list the names (and links) of the top 3-5 Stale projects directly in the README for quicker visibility.
*   **"Recently Completed" / "Recently Published":**
    *   If you have "Complete" or "Published" statuses, highlighting papers that recently reached these milestones could be valuable.
*   **Average Progress:**
    *   You could calculate an average percentage from the `generateProgressBar` output across all papers and display it. Or show a distribution (e.g., X papers 0-25% done, Y papers 26-50% done, etc.).
*   **Clearer Status Source (Optional & More Complex):**
    *   If you wanted to distinguish, you could modify the script to store `statusFromProgressMD` and `inferredStatus` separately. Then the README could say:
        *   `Active (Manual): X`
        *   `Active (Inferred): Y`
        This adds complexity but provides more transparency.

**Interactivity & Links:**

*   **Links to Filtered Views on Dashboard:**
    *   If your `index.html` dashboard supports filtering (e.g., by status, priority), you could add links from the README like: `[View all Active Projects on Dashboard](your-dashboard-url?status=Active)`.
*   **Project-Specific Mini-Dashboards (Very Advanced):**
    *   For very large projects, each 100SV repository *could* eventually have its own mini-README dashboard generated by a similar (but simpler) script, with the main hub aggregating key stats. This is likely overkill for now.

**Visuals:**

*   **Simple Text-Based Charts/Graphs:**
    *   For status or priority distribution, you could generate simple bar charts using text characters directly in the README.
*   **SVG Badges:**
    *   Generate dynamic SVG badges (e.g., using `shields.io` principles but self-generated if `stats.json` isn't publicly hosted for `shields.io` to consume directly) for key stats like "Active Projects" or "Total Papers". This requires more setup.

**Methodology & Clarity:**

*   **Link to a "How Stats are Calculated" Section:**
    *   A brief explanation (perhaps in `SETUP.md` or a dedicated `METHODOLOGY.md`) clarifying how statuses are inferred, how commits are counted, etc., could be linked from the README.

**Recommendation for Next Steps:**

1.  Consider adding the "Breakdown by Research Area" as it leverages existing data and provides good insight.
2.  Listing the actual "Stale" projects might be a good quick win for actionable insights.

Start with changes that provide the most value for the effort. The current README is already quite informative!
